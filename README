This module wraps the complex arithmetic functions defined in complex.h.
Consequently, you need a C compiler that provides complex.h.

Build in the usual way:

 perl Makefile.PL
 make
 make test
 make install


=====================
Which Math::Complex_C
=====================

There are three Math::Complex_C modules, each in it's own separate distro:

1) Math::Complex_C
  Accesses the C compiler's 'double' precision (usually 53-bit) complex arithemtic operations;

2) Math::Complex_C::L
  Accesses the C compiler's 'long double' precision (usually 64-bit) complex arithemtic operations;

3) Math::Complex_C::Q
  Accesses the C compiler's '__float128' precision (usually 113-bit) complex arithemtic operations;
